\subsection*{Learning Objectives}
Students need to be able to\ldots
\begin{itemize}
	\item Solve 2nd order homogeneous ODEs.
    \item Recognize different types of damping in 2nd order homogeneous ODEs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notes}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item This question focuses on having students understand a simple application of second order ODEs with a damped spring. They may struggle with the definition of quasi-period, but you can try to draw a graph of a sinusoidal function modulated by a ramp function and it should become clear to them.

        \item This is an interesting question that has students practise setting up two first-order ODEs and then deriving a second-order ODE from them. They also practise recognizing the type of damping in this system.
