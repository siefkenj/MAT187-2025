\subsection*{Learning Objectives}
Students need to be able to solve separable and first-order linear ODEs, understand integrating factors, and determine equilibrium points from phase plots.


\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Here is another question that covers phase line plots and has the students interpret them to classify equilibria and predict end behaviours. Students may still be a bit confused by the meaning of the phase line plot.
    
    \item Here are a few standard ODEs for the students to get comfortable applying the techniques presented in lecture.

    \item The goal for this question for students to get some practice with real world modelling, and to explore bifurcation diagrams without talking about bifurcation diagrams. Students may write the wrong sign for the capacity factor. 
\end{enumerate}
