	\question
	In a classic problem, you are trying to find the volume of a wine barrel.
	Let $r(\ell)$ represent the radius of the barrel $\ell$ cm from the base. The total
	length of the barrel is 80cm.

	You know the volume of the barrel can be computed exactly by
	\[
		\int_0^{80}\pi [r(\ell)]^2\,\mathrm d \ell.
	\]

	You have measured the barrel in several places and gotten the following data
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
			r(0) & r(20) & r(40) & r(60) & r(80) \\
			12.8 & 21.2  & 22.7  & 21.4  & 13.4  \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	\begin{parts}
		\item Make a sketch of the barrel's profile. Make a second sketch of $\pi [r(\ell)]^2$.

		\item Based on your sketch, do you think using a trapezoid approximation will produce an over
		or under estimate for the volume?

		\item Use a trapezoid approximation to estimate the volume of the barrel.

		\item Use a Simpson's approximation to estimate the volume of the barrel.

		\emph{Reminder:}
		if $p$ is a quadratic polynomial,
		\[
			\int_a^b p(x)\,\mathrm d x = \frac{b-a}{6}\left(p(a)+4p\Big(\frac{a+b}{2}\Big)+p(b)\right)
		\]

		\item The exact (rounded) volume of the barrel is 104384cm$^3$. What approximation
		method was most accurate? Why?

	\question
	Let $y(t)$ represent the displacement of an object at time $t$.
	A general model comes from Newton's laws:
	\[
		y''(t)= V(y'(t)) + P(y(t)) + F_{\text{external}}(t)

		no forces proportional to velocity. The only force is in the opposite direction of displacement. Write down a general equation for a frictionless spring.
